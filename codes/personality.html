                    When I did not love Him he cared for me. 
                    When I was not a friend to Him he was better than a friend to me. 
                    When I was in the hospital multiple times, I called on His name He made a way for Him.
                    And if that was not enough while I was yet a sinner, Jesus Christ died for me. He is my hero because he deserves it.
